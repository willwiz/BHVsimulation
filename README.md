# PSsimulations

This is the Thesis project for Will Zhang for the simulation of Permanent Set(PS) in bioprosthetic heart valves under long term cyclic loading. 

This project utilize PYTHON as the glue language and for data processing, C++ for the constitutive model and parameter estimation, and external fortran code for Finite element simulation. 

The PYTHON c++ interface is done using Pybind11
